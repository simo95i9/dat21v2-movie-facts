## Description 
A list of implemented endpoints can be found on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)  
or alternatively in [MovieFactsServices.java](src/main/java/moviefacts/services/MovieFactsServices.java#L10)


## Special Sauce
When "rendering" a Movie-object we will also query the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org).  
If possible a link to the movie poster will be included. You have to supply your own API key.
